1H-VideoQA,"Question-answering benchmarks for long-context video understanding need to have at least two properties: first, they need to contain long videos and second, their questions need to be designed to in a way that can differentiate among models that operate over different context lengths. Unfortunately, no existing benchmarks satisfy these properties for evaluating models that can handle hours-long videos like Gemini 1.5 Pro. The publicly available question answering benchmark with the longest videos is EgoSchema (Mangalam et al., 2023), but its videos are at most 3 minutes (i.e., 180 frames) in length. To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce a new benchmark, 1H-VideoQA, composed of 125 five-way multiple-choice questions over public videos 40-105 minutes long.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05530,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
CommonSenseQA,"When answering a question, people often draw upon their rich world knowledge in addition to the particular context. Recent work has focused primarily on answering questions given some relevant document or context, and required very little general background. To investigate question answering with prior knowledge, we present CommonsenseQA: a challenging new dataset for commonsense question answering. To capture common sense beyond associations, we extract from ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017) multiple target concepts that have the same semantic relation to a single source concept. Crowd-workers are asked to author multiple-choice questions that mention the source concept and discriminate in turn between each of the target concepts. This encourages workers to create questions with complex semantics that often require prior knowledge. We create 12,247 questions through this procedure and demonstrate the difficulty of our task with a large number of strong baselines. Our best baseline is based on BERT-large (Devlin et al., 2018) and obtains 56% accuracy, well below human performance, which is 89%.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00937v2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
AGIEval,"Evaluating the general abilities of foundation models to tackle human-level tasks is a vital aspect of their development and application in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Traditional benchmarks, which rely on artificial datasets, may not accurately represent human-level capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AGIEval, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess foundation model in the context of human-centric standardized exams, such as college entrance exams, law school admission tests, math competitions, and lawyer qualification tests. We evaluate several state-of-the-art foundation models, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Text-Davinci-003, using this benchmark. Impressively, GPT-4 surpasses average human performance on SAT, LSAT, and math competitions, attaining a 95% accuracy rate on the SAT Math test and a 92.5% accuracy on the English test of the Chinese national college entrance exam. This demonstrates the extraordinary performance of contemporary foundation models. In contrast, we also find that GPT-4 is less proficient in tasks that require complex reasoning or specific domain knowledge. Our comprehensive analyses of model capabilities (understanding, knowledge, reasoning, and calculation) reveal these models' strengths and limitations, providing valuable insights into future directions for enhancing their general capabilities. By concentrating on tasks pertinent to human cognition and decision-making, our benchmark delivers a more meaningful and robust evaluation of foundation models' performance in real-world scenarios.

However, three pivotal questions remain unanswered: (1) How effective are current LLMs in utilizing tools? (2) How can we enhance LLMs' ability to utilize tools? (3) What obstacles need to be overcome to leverage tools? To address these questions, we introduce API-Bank, a groundbreaking benchmark, specifically designed for tool-augmented LLMs. For the first question, we develop a runnable evaluation system consisting of 73 API tools. We annotate 314 tool-use dialogues with 753 API calls to assess the existing LLMs' capabilities in planning, retrieving, and calling APIs. For the second question, we construct a comprehensive training set containing 1,888 tool-use dialogues from 2,138 APIs spanning 1,000 distinct domains. Using this dataset, we train Lynx, a tool-augmented LLM initialized from Alpaca. Experimental results demonstrate that GPT-3.5 exhibits improved tool utilization compared to GPT-3, while GPT-4 excels in planning. However, there is still significant potential for further improvement. Moreover, Lynx surpasses Alpaca's tool utilization performance by more than 26 pts and approaches the effectiveness of GPT-3.5.

BeHonest,"     Previous works on Large Language Models (LLMs) have mainly focused on evaluating their helpfulness or harmlessness. However, honesty, another crucial alignment criterion, has received relatively less attention. Dishonest behaviors in LLMs, such as spreading misinformation and defrauding users, present severe risks that intensify as these models approach superintelligent levels. Enhancing honesty in LLMs addresses critical limitations and helps uncover latent capabilities that are not readily expressed. This underscores the urgent need for reliable methods and benchmarks to effectively ensure and evaluate the honesty of LLMs.
    In this paper, we introduce BeHonest, a pioneering benchmark specifically designed to assess honesty in LLMs comprehensively. BeHonest evaluates three essential aspects of honesty: awareness of knowledge boundaries, avoidance of deceit, and consistency in responses. Building on this foundation, we designed 10 scenarios to evaluate and analyze 9 popular LLMs on the market, including both closed-source and open-source models from different model families with varied model sizes. Our findings indicate that there is still significant room for improvement in the honesty of LLMs. We encourage the AI community to prioritize honesty alignment in these models, which can harness their full potential to benefit society while preventing them from causing harm through deception or inconsistency.

BigBench Hard,"Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) is a diverse evaluation suite that focuses on tasks believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. Language models have already made good progress on this benchmark, with the best model in the BIG-Bench paper outperforming average reported human-rater results on 65% of the BIG-Bench tasks via few-shot prompting. But on what tasks do language models fall short of average human-rater performance, and are those tasks actually unsolvable by current language models?
In this work, we focus on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the average human-rater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex (code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH, finding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves.

This paper introduces the Biological Lab Protocol benchmark (BioLP-bench) that evaluates the ability of language models to find and correct mistakes in a diverse set of laboratory protocols commonly used in biological research.

To evaluate understanding of the protocols by AI models, we introduced in these protocols numerous mistakes that would still allow them to function correctly. After that we introduced in each protocol a single mistake that would cause it to fail. We then gave these modified protocols to an LLM, prompting it to identify the mistake that would cause it to fail, and measured the accuracy of a model in identifying such mistakes across many test cases. State-of-the-art language models demonstrated poor performance compared to human experts, and in most cases couldn’t correctly identify the mistake.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.21.608694v3,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, we find these perception-demanding tasks cast significant challenges for current multimodal LLMs because they resist mediation through natural language. Blink reformats 14 classic computer vision tasks into 3,807 multiple-choice questions, paired with single or multiple images and visual prompting. While humans get 95.70% accuracy on average, Blink is surprisingly challenging for existing multimodal LLMs: even the best-performing GPT-4V and Gemini achieve accuracies of 51.26% and 45.72%, only 13.17% and 7.63% higher than random guessing, indicating that such perception abilities have not ""emerged"" yet in recent multimodal LLMs. Our analysis also highlights that specialist CV models could solve these problems much better, suggesting potential pathways for future improvements.

EgoSchema,"We introduce EgoSchema, a very long-form video question-answering dataset, and benchmark to evaluate long video understanding capabilities of modern vision and language systems. Derived from Ego4D, EgoSchema consists of over 5000 human curated multiple choice question answer pairs, spanning over 250 hours of real video data, covering a very broad range of natural human activity and behavior. For each question, EgoSchema requires the correct answer to be selected between five given options based on a three-minute-long video clip. While some prior works have proposed video datasets with long clip lengths, we posit that merely the length of the video clip does not truly capture the temporal difficulty of the video task that is being considered. To remedy this, we introduce temporal certificate sets, a general notion for capturing the intrinsic temporal understanding length associated with a broad range of video understanding tasks & datasets. Based on this metric, we find EgoSchema to have intrinsic temporal lengths over 5.7x longer than the second closest dataset and 10x to 100x longer than any other video understanding dataset. Further, our evaluation of several current state-of-the-art video and language models shows them to be severely lacking in long-term video understanding capabilities. Even models with several billions of parameters achieve QA accuracy less than 33% (random is 20%) on the EgoSchema multi-choice question answering task, while humans achieve about 76% accuracy.

Evaluation For Discrimination,"As language models (LMs) advance, interest is growing in applying them to high-stakes societal decisions, such as determining financing or housing eligibility. However, their potential for discrimination in such contexts raises ethical concerns, motivating the need for better methods to evaluate these risks. We present a method for proactively evaluating the potential discriminatory impact of LMs in a wide range of use cases, including hypothetical use cases where they have not yet been deployed. Specifically, we use an LM to generate a wide array of potential prompts that decision-makers may input into an LM, spanning 70 diverse decision scenarios across society, and systematically vary the demographic information in each prompt. Applying this methodology reveals patterns of both positive and negative discrimination in the Claude 2.0 model in select settings when no interventions are applied. While we do not endorse or permit the use of language models to make automated decisions for the high-risk use cases we study, we demonstrate techniques to significantly decrease both positive and negative discrimination through careful prompt engineering, providing pathways toward safer deployment in use cases where they may be appropriate. Our work enables developers and policymakers to anticipate, measure, and address discrimination as language model capabilities and applications continue to expand.

This direction remains under-explored, resulting in substantial impediments to the progress of factuality evaluators. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a benchmark for Factuality Evaluation of large Language Models, referred to as felm. In this benchmark, we collect responses generated from LLMs and annotate factuality labels in a fine-grained manner. Contrary to previous studies that primarily concentrate on the factuality of world knowledge (e.g.~information from Wikipedia), felm focuses on factuality across diverse domains, spanning from world knowledge to math and reasoning. Our annotation is based on text segments, which can help pinpoint specific factual errors. The factuality annotations are further supplemented by predefined error types and reference links that either support or contradict the statement. In our experiments, we investigate the performance of several LLM-based factuality evaluators on felm, including both vanilla LLMs and those augmented with retrieval mechanisms and chain-of-thought processes. Our findings reveal that while retrieval aids factuality evaluation, current LLMs are far from satisfactory to faithfully detect factual errors.

GSM-Plus,"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks. However, there are increasing debates regarding whether these models truly understand and apply mathematical knowledge or merely rely on shortcuts for mathematical reasoning. One essential and frequently occurring evidence is that when the math questions are slightly changed, LLMs can behave incorrectly. This motivates us to evaluate the robustness of LLMs' math reasoning capability by testing a wide range of question variations. We introduce the adversarial grade school math (GSM-Plus) dataset, an extension of GSM8K augmented with various mathematical perturbations. Our experiments on 25 LLMs and 4 prompting techniques show that while LLMs exhibit different levels of math reasoning abilities, their performances are far from robust. In particular, even for problems that have been solved in GSM8K, LLMs can make mistakes when new statements are added or the question targets are altered. We also explore whether more robust performance can be achieved by composing existing prompting methods, in which we try an iterative method that generates and verifies each intermediate thought based on its reasoning goal and calculation result.

HellaSwag,"Recent work by Zellers et al. (2018) introduced a new task of commonsense natural language inference: given an event description such as ""A woman sits at a piano,"" a machine must select the most likely followup: ""She sets her fingers on the keys."" With the introduction of BERT, near human-level performance was reached. Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense inference?
    In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans (>95% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (<48%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical 'Goldilocks' zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models.
    Our construction of HellaSwag, and its resulting difficulty, sheds light on the inner workings of deep pretrained models.

However, these test-cases can be limited in both quantity and quality for fully assessing the functional correctness of the generated code. Such limitation in the existing benchmarks begs the following question: In the era of LLMs, is the code generated really correct? To answer this, we propose EvalPlus – a code synthesis evaluation framework to rigorously benchmark the functional correctness of LLM-synthesized code. EvalPlus augments a given evaluation dataset with large amounts of test-cases newly produced by an automatic test input generator, powered by both LLM- and mutation-based strategies. While EvalPlus is general, we extend the test-cases of the popular HumanEval benchmark by 80x to build HumanEval+. Our extensive evaluation across 26 popular LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 and ChatGPT) demonstrates that HumanEval+ is able to catch significant amounts of previously undetected wrong code synthesized by LLMs, reducing the pass@k by up-to 19.3-28.9%. We also surprisingly found that test insufficiency can lead to mis-ranking. For example, both WizardCoder-CodeLlama and Phind-CodeLlama now outperform ChatGPT on HumanEval+, while none of them could on HumanEval.

To mitigate this issue, we taught the model to adhere to an Instruction Hierarchy[20]. At a
high level, we now have three classifications of messages sent to o1: system messages, developer
messages, and user messages. We collected examples of these different types of messages conflicting
with each other, and supervised o1 to follow the instructions in the system message over developer
messages, and instructions in developer messages over user messages.
We created several evaluations to measure the model’s ability to follow the Instruction Hierarchy

following instructions in the correct priority when compared to GPT-4o.

Lab-bench,"There is widespread optimism that frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-augmented systems have the potential to rapidly accelerate scientific discovery across disciplines. Today, many benchmarks exist to measure LLM knowledge and reasoning on textbook-style science questions, but few if any benchmarks are designed to evaluate language model performance on practical tasks required for scientific research, such as literature search, protocol planning, and data analysis. As a step toward building such benchmarks, we introduce the Language Agent Biology Benchmark (LAB-Bench), a broad dataset of over 2,400 multiple choice questions for evaluating AI systems on a range of practical biology research capabilities, including recall and reasoning over literature, interpretation of figures, access and navigation of databases, and comprehension and manipulation of DNA and protein sequences. Importantly, in contrast to previous scientific benchmarks, we expect that an AI system that can achieve consistently high scores on the more difficult LAB-Bench tasks would serve as a useful assistant for researchers in areas such as literature search and molecular cloning. As an initial assessment of the emergent scientific task capabilities of frontier language models, we measure performance of several against our benchmark and report results compared to human expert biology researchers. We will continue to update and expand LAB-Bench over time, and expect it to serve as a useful tool in the development of automated research systems going forward. A public subset of LAB-Bench is available for use at the following URL: this https URL ",https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10362,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Lambada,"We introduce LAMBADA, a dataset to evaluate the capabilities of computational models for text understanding by means of a word prediction task. LAMBADA is a collection of narrative passages sharing the characteristic that human subjects are able to guess their last word if they are exposed to the whole passage, but not if they only see the last sentence preceding the target word. To succeed on LAMBADA, computational models cannot simply rely on local context, but must be able to keep track of information in the broader discourse. We show that LAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of several state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this novel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to encourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of broad context in natural language text.

LawBench,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various
aspects. However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-critical legal
domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whether they can
reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose a comprehen-
sive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously crafted
to have precise assessment of the LLMs’ legal capabilities from three cognitive
levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize needed
legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding: whether
LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal text; (3) Legal
knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their legal knowledge and
make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal tasks. LawBench contains
20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label classification (SLC), multi-label
classification (MLC), regression, extraction and generation. We perform exten-
sive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench, including 20 multilingual LLMs, 22
Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific LLMs. The results show that GPT-4
remains the best-performing LLM in the legal domain, surpassing the others by a
significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMs on legal specific text brings certain
improvements, we are still a long way from obtaining usable and reliable LLMs

LiveBench,"Test set contamination, wherein test data from a benchmark ends up in a newer model's training set, is a well-documented obstacle for fair LLM evaluation and can quickly render benchmarks obsolete. To mitigate this, many recent benchmarks crowdsource new prompts and evaluations from human or LLM judges; however, these can introduce significant biases, and break down when scoring hard questions. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for LLMs designed to be immune to both test set contamination and the pitfalls of LLM judging and human crowdsourcing. We release LiveBench, the first benchmark that (1) contains frequently-updated questions from recent information sources, (2) scores answers automatically according to objective ground-truth values, and (3) contains a wide variety of challenging tasks, spanning math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis. To achieve this, LiveBench contains questions that are based on recently-released math competitions, arXiv papers, news articles, and datasets, and it contains harder, contamination-free versions of tasks from previous benchmarks such as Big-Bench Hard, AMPS, and IFEval. We evaluate many prominent closed-source models, as well as dozens of open-source models ranging from 0.5B to 110B in size. LiveBench is difficult, with top models achieving below 65% accuracy. We release all questions, code, and model answers. Questions will be added and updated on a monthly basis, and we will release new tasks and harder versions of tasks over time so that LiveBench can distinguish between the capabilities of LLMs as they improve in the future.

Nevertheless, the current MCoT benchmark still faces some challenges: (1) absence of visual modal reasoning, (2) single-step visual modal reasoning, and (3) Domain missing, thereby hindering the development of MCoT. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel benchmark (M3CoT) to address the above challenges, advancing the multi-domain, multi-step, and multi-modal CoT. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation involving abundant MCoT approaches on Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). In addition, we highlight that the current VLLMs still struggle to correctly reason in M3CoT and there remains a large gap between existing VLLMs and human performance in M3CoT, despite their superior results on previous MCoT benchmarks. To our knowledge, we take the first meaningful step toward the multi-domain, multi-step, and multi-modal scenario in MCoT. We hope that M3CoT can serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation in multi-domain, multi-step, multi-modal chain-of-thought research.

The best-performing GPT-4V model achieves an overall accuracy of 49.9%, substantially outperforming Bard, the second-best performer, by 15.1%. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the superiority of GPT-4V is mainly attributed to its enhanced visual perception and mathematical reasoning. However, GPT-4V still falls short of human performance by 10.4%, as it often struggles to understand complex figures and perform rigorous reasoning. This significant gap underscores the critical role that MathVista will play in the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of tackling mathematically intensive and visually rich real-world tasks. We further explore the new ability of self-verification, the application of self-consistency, and the interactive chatbot capabilities of GPT-4V, highlighting its promising potential for future research.

MixEval,"Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks fail to capture the comprehensiveness and nuance of real-world queries, while LLM-as-judge benchmarks suffer from grading biases and limited query quantity. Both of them may also become contaminated over time. User-facing evaluation, such as Chatbot Arena, provides reliable signals but is costly and slow. In this work, we propose MixEval, a new paradigm for establishing efficient, gold-standard LLM evaluation by strategically mixing off-the-shelf benchmarks. It bridges (1) comprehensive and well-distributed real-world user queries and (2) efficient and fairly-graded ground-truth-based benchmarks, by matching queries mined from the web with similar queries from existing benchmarks. Based on MixEval, we further build MixEval-Hard, which offers more room for model improvement. Our benchmarks' advantages lie in (1) a 0.96 model ranking correlation with Chatbot Arena arising from the highly impartial query distribution and grading mechanism, (2) fast, cheap, and reproducible execution (6% of the time and cost of MMLU), and (3) dynamic evaluation enabled by the rapid and stable data update pipeline.

To enable multi-needle insertion into our context, use --multi_needle True.

This inserts the first needle at the specified depth_percent, then evenly distributes subsequent needles through the remaining context after this depth.

For even spacing, it calculates the depth_percent_interval as:

depth_percent_interval = (100 - depth_percent) / len(self.needles)

So, the first needle is placed at a depth percent of depth_percent, the second at depth_percent + depth_percent_interval, the third at depth_percent + 2 * depth_percent_interval, and so on.",https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack/blob/main/README.md,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
Multi-round Co-reference Resolution (MRCR)," In the Multi-

a user and a model, in which the user requests writing (e.g. poems, riddles, essays) on different
topics proceeded by the model responses. In each conversation, two user requests containing topics
and writing formats distinct from the rest of the conversation are randomly placed in the context.
Given the conversation, the model must reproduce the model’s output (the needle) resulting from
one of the two requests (the key). Either the formats, the topics, or both, overlap in order to create
a single key that is adversarially similar to the query key. For instance, the request “Reproduce the
poem about penguins.” requires the model to distinguish the poem about penguins from the poem
about flamingos, and “Reproduce the first poem about penguins.” requires the model to reason about
ordering. We score MRCR via a string-similarity measure between the model output and the correct

MultiPL-E,"     Large language models have demonstrated the ability to generate both natural language and programming language text. Such models open up the possibility of multi-language code generation: could code generation models generalize knowledge from one language to another? Although contemporary code generation models can generate semantically correct Python code, little is known about their abilities with other languages. We propose MultiPL-E, a system for translating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages. We create the first massively multilingual code generation benchmark by using MultiPL-E to translate two popular Python code generation benchmarks to 18 additional programming languages.
    We use MultiPL-E to extend the HumanEval benchmark and MBPP benchmark to 18 languages that encompass a range of programming paradigms and popularity. Using these new parallel benchmarks, we evaluate the multi-language performance of three state-of-the-art code generation models: Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder. We find that Codex matches or even exceeds its performance on Python for several other languages. The range of programming languages represented in MultiPL-E allow us to explore the impact of language frequency and language features on model performance. Finally, the MultiPL-E approach of compiling code generation benchmarks to new programming languages is both scalable and extensible, making it straightforward to evaluate new models, benchmarks, and languages.

📚 MMLU-Pro (Massive Multitask Language Understanding - Pro version, paper). MMLU-Pro is a refined version of the MMLU dataset. MMLU has been the reference multichoice knowledge dataset. However, recent research showed that it is both noisy (some questions are unanswerable) and now too easy (through the evolution of model capabilities and increased contamination). MMLU-Pro presents the models with ten choices instead of 4, requires reasoning on more questions, and has been expertly reviewed to reduce the amount of noise. It is of higher quality than the original and harder.

📚 GPQA (Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark, paper). GPQA is an extremely hard knowledge dataset, where questions were designed by domain experts in their field (PhD-level in biology, physics, chemistry, etc.) to be hard to answer by laypersons but (relatively) easy for experts. Questions have gone through several rounds of validation to ensure both difficulty and factuality. The dataset is also only accessible through gating mechanisms, which should reduce contamination risks. (This is also why we don’t provide a plain text example from this dataset, as requested by the authors in the paper).

💭MuSR (Multistep Soft Reasoning, paper). MuSR is a very fun new dataset made of algorithmically generated complex problems of around 1K words in length. The problems are either murder mysteries, object placement questions, or team allocation optimizations. To solve these, the models must combine reasoning and very long-range context parsing. Few models score better than random performance.

🧮 MATH (Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics, Level 5 subset, paper). MATH is a compilation of high-school-level competition problems gathered from several sources, formatted consistently using Latex for equations and Asymptote for figures. Generations must fit a very specific output format. We keep only the hardest questions.

🤝 IFEval (Instruction Following Evaluation, paper). IFEval is a fairly interesting dataset that tests the capability of models to clearly follow explicit instructions, such as “include keyword x” or “use format y”.

The benchmark probes pre-trained models for their transfer capabilities, in a zero-shot / few-shot or limited finetuning regime. For these purposes, the Perception Test introduces 11.6k real-world videos, 23s average length, designed to show perceptually interesting situations, filmed by around 100 participants worldwide. The videos are densely annotated with six types of labels (multiple-choice and grounded video question-answers, object and point tracks, temporal action and sound segments), enabling both language and non-language evaluations. The fine-tuning and validation splits of the benchmark are publicly available (CC-BY license), in addition to a challenge server with a held-out test split.

explanation of the introduced error. These altered protocols and explanation were then provided in
another round to additional experts to draft questions. Question writers were instructed to select an
altered protocol, determine if the introduced error aligned with the explanation and if they agreed it
would indeed produce a negative outcome. If so, they were asked to craft a question that consisted of
a hypothetical experimental result (e.g. After performing the PCR in step 5, I do not see any bands
on a gel. What could I change to improve the outcome of my PCR?)
 To evaluate models’ ability to troubleshoot commonly published lab protocols, we modify 108
multiple choice questions from FutureHouse’s ProtocolQA dataset [31] to be open-ended short
answer questions, which makes the evaluation harder and more realistic than the multiple-choice
version. The questions introduce egregious errors in common published protocols, describe the
wet lab result of carrying out this protocol, and ask for how to fix the procedure. To compare
model performance to that of PhD experts, we performed new expert baselining on this evaluation

PubMedQA has 1k expert-annotated, 61.2k unlabeled and 211.3k artificially generated QA instances. Each PubMedQA instance is composed of (1) a question which is either an existing research article title or derived from one, (2) a context which is the corresponding abstract without its conclusion, (3) a long answer, which is the conclusion of the abstract and, presumably, answers the research question, and (4) a yes/no/maybe answer which summarizes the conclusion. PubMedQA is the first QA dataset where reasoning over biomedical research texts, especially their quantitative contents, is required to answer the questions. Our best performing model, multi-phase fine-tuning of BioBERT with long answer bag-of-word statistics as additional supervision, achieves 68.1% accuracy, compared to single human performance of 78.0% accuracy and majority-baseline of 55.2% accuracy, leaving much room for improvement.

Qasper,"Readers of academic research papers often read with the goal of answering specific questions. Question Answering systems that can answer those questions can make consumption of the content much more efficient. However, building such tools requires data that reflect the difficulty of the task arising from complex reasoning about claims made in multiple parts of a paper. In contrast, existing information-seeking question answering datasets usually contain questions about generic factoid-type information. We therefore present QASPER, a dataset of 5,049 questions over 1,585 Natural Language Processing papers. Each question is written by an NLP practitioner who read only the title and abstract of the corresponding paper, and the question seeks information present in the full text. The questions are then answered by a separate set of NLP practitioners who also provide supporting evidence to answers. We find that existing models that do well on other QA tasks do not perform well on answering these questions, underperforming humans by at least 27 F1 points when answering them from entire papers, motivating further research in document-grounded, information-seeking QA, which our dataset is designed to facilitate.

We create and release RealToxicityPrompts, a dataset of 100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text, paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used toxicity classifier. Using RealToxicityPrompts, we find that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts. We empirically assess several controllable generation methods, and find that while data- or compute-intensive methods (e.g., adaptive pretraining on non-toxic data) are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions (e.g., banning ""bad"" words), no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration. To pinpoint the potential cause of such persistent toxic degeneration, we analyze two web text corpora used to pretrain several LMs (including GPT-2; Radford et. al, 2019), and find a significant amount of offensive, factually unreliable, and otherwise toxic content. Our work provides a test bed for evaluating toxic generations by LMs and stresses the need for better data selection processes for pretraining.

We suggest this problem arises because jailbreak researchers lack a standard, high-quality benchmark for evaluating jailbreak performance, leaving researchers to create their own. To create a benchmark, researchers must choose a dataset of forbidden prompts to which a victim model will respond, along with an evaluation method that scores the harmfulness of the victim model's responses. We show that existing benchmarks suffer from significant shortcomings and introduce the StrongREJECT benchmark to address these issues. StrongREJECT's dataset contains prompts that victim models must answer with specific, harmful information, while its automated evaluator measures the extent to which a response gives useful information to forbidden prompts. In doing so, the StrongREJECT evaluator achieves state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments of jailbreak effectiveness. Notably, we find that existing evaluation methods significantly overstate jailbreak effectiveness compared to human judgments and the StrongREJECT evaluator. We describe a surprising and novel phenomenon that explains this discrepancy: jailbreaks bypassing a victim model's safety fine-tuning tend to reduce its capabilities. Together, our findings underscore the need for researchers to use a high-quality benchmark, such as StrongREJECT, when developing new jailbreak attacks.

Existing datasets either have a small proportion of questions about text (e.g., the VQA dataset) or are too small (e.g., the VizWiz dataset). TextVQA contains 45,336 questions on 28,408 images that require reasoning about text to answer. Second, we introduce a novel model architecture that reads text in the image, reasons about it in the context of the image and the question, and predicts an answer which might be a deduction based on the text and the image or composed of the strings found in the image. Consequently, we call our approach Look, Read, Reason & Answer (LoRRA). We show that LoRRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art VQA models on our TextVQA dataset.

ToxiGen,"Toxic language detection systems often falsely flag text that contains minority group mentions as toxic, as those groups are often the targets of online hate. Such over-reliance on spurious correlations also causes systems to struggle with detecting implicitly toxic language. To help mitigate these issues, we create ToxiGen, a new large-scale and machine-generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign statements about 13 minority groups. We develop a demonstration-based prompting framework and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model. Controlling machine generation in this way allows ToxiGen to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of ToxiGen and find that annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language.

Translated ARC,"Underrepresented Languages
GPT-4o shows improved reading comprehension and reasoning across a sample of historically
underrepresented languages, and narrows the gap in performance between these languages and
English.
To evaluate GPT-4o’s performance in text across a select group of languages historically underrep-
resented in Internet text, we collaborated with external researchers 12 and language facilitators to
develop evaluations in five African languages: Amharic, Hausa, Northern Sotho (Sepedi), Swahili,
Yoruba. This initial assessment focused on translating two popular language benchmarks and
creating small novel language-specific reading comprehension evaluation for Amharic, Hausa and
Yoruba.

The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.

In this paper, we present Uhura -- a new benchmark that focuses on two tasks in six typologically-diverse African languages, created via human translation of existing English benchmarks. The first dataset, Uhura-ARC-Easy, is composed of multiple-choice science questions. The second, Uhura-TruthfulQA, is a safety benchmark testing the truthfulness of models on topics including health, law, finance, and politics. We highlight the challenges creating benchmarks with highly technical content for LRLs and outline mitigation strategies. Our evaluation reveals a significant performance gap between proprietary models such as GPT-4o and o1-preview, and Claude models, and open-source models like Meta's LLaMA and Google's Gemma. Additionally, all models perform better in English than in African languages. These results indicate that LMs struggle with answering scientific questions and are more prone to generating false claims in low-resource African languages. Our findings underscore the necessity for continuous improvement of multilingual LM capabilities in LRL settings to ensure safe and reliable use in real-world contexts.

Unstructured Multimodal Data Analytics,"Unstructured Multimodal Data Analytics Task
While performing data analytics on structured data is a very mature field with many successful
methods, the majority of real-world data exists in unstructured formats like images and conversations.
We investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable unstructured data analytics
and explore how LLMs can directly analyze this vast pool of multimodal information.
As an instance of unstructured data analytics, we perform an image structuralization task. We
present LLMs with a set of 1024 images with the goal of extracting the information that the images
contain into a structured data sheet (see Appendix 12.7 for examples prompts used in this study). As
this is a long-context task, in case where context length of models does not permit processing of all
the images at once, we use mini-batches with different batch sizes to alleviate this shortcoming. In

To address this, we introduce V*, an LLM-guided visual search mechanism that employs the world knowledge in LLMs for efficient visual querying. When combined with an MLLM, this mechanism enhances collaborative reasoning, contextual understanding, and precise targeting of specific visual elements. This integration results in a new MLLM meta-architecture, named Show, sEArch, and TelL (SEAL).

Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing ~0.25M images, ~0.76M questions, and ~10M answers (this http URL), and discuss the information it provides.

VisualWebArena,"Autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and executing actions on the web offer a promising avenue for automating computer tasks. However, the majority of existing benchmarks primarily focus on text-based agents, neglecting many natural tasks that require visual information to effectively solve.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VisualWebArena, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of multimodal web agents on realistic \textit{visually grounded tasks}. VisualWebArena comprises of a set of diverse and complex web-based tasks that evaluate various capabilities of autonomous multimodal agents. To perform on this benchmark, agents need to accurately process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based autonomous agents, including several multimodal models. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identify several limitations of text-only LLM agents, and reveal gaps in the capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal language agents.

VoxPopuli," Speech recognition and translation technologies are being widely adopted to enable human-to-computer interaction, real-time human-to-human communication, and access to multimedia content without language barriers. These technologies are currently available in only a handful of widely spoken languages, however, and there are approximately 6,500 languages spoken around the globe. To be more useful, these AI systems need to work for many more.

To accelerate the creation of new natural language processing (NLP) systems for use in more regions of the world, Facebook AI is releasing VoxPopuli, a large-scale multilingual body of audio recordings that provide 400,000 hours of unlabeled speech data in 23 languages. It is the largest open data set released thus far for self-supervised learning and semisupervised learning. VoxPopuli also contains 1,800 hours of transcribed speeches in 15 languages. It also channels their oral interpretations into 15 target languages, for a total of 17,300 hours, with alignments at utterance level (which can be a single word, a sentence, or a distinct sound such as “umm”).

Getting to the realistic goal of advanced NLP for dozens of languages is a time-intensive project. Recent automation advances (wav2vec 2.0 and wav2vec-U) have shown promising results in reducing—or even eliminating—the requirements of labeled data in building these technologies, which are based on learning from large-scale unlabeled data. Previous open-speech data sets (such as Libri-light) are limited in size or language coverage, which restricts the full power of these techniques. The AI research community simply needs more language data—a lot more.

VoxPopuli provides 9,000 to 18,000 hours of unlabeled speech per language; previous data sets have had only about 130 hours. This substantial new body of speech-to-speech translation data will be an important supplement to the existing speech-to-text translation corpora, such as CoVoST V2.

WHOOPS!,"Weird, unusual, and uncanny images pique the curiosity of observers because they challenge commonsense. For example, an image released during the 2022 world cup depicts the famous soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess, which playfully violates our expectation that their competition should occur on the football field. Humans can easily recognize and interpret these unconventional images, but can AI models do the same? We introduce WHOOPS!, a new dataset and benchmark for visual commonsense. The dataset is comprised of purposefully commonsense-defying images created by designers using publicly-available image generation tools like Midjourney. We consider several tasks posed over the dataset. In addition to image captioning, cross-modal matching, and visual question answering, we introduce a difficult explanation generation task, where models must identify and explain why a given image is unusual.

Inspired by human-like mathematical reasoning, we introduce We-Math, the first benchmark specifically designed to explore the problem-solving principles beyond the end-to-end performance.

We meticulously collect and categorize 6.5K visual math problems, spanning 67 hierarchical knowledge concepts and 5 layers of knowledge granularity. We firstly decompose composite problems into sub-problems according to the required knowledge concepts and introduce a novel four-dimensional metric, namely Insufficient Knowledge (IK), Inadequate Generalization (IG), Complete Mastery (CM), and Rote Memorization (RM) to hierarchically assess inherent issues in LMMs' reasoning process.

With We-Math, we conduct a thorough evaluation of existing LMMs in visual mathematical reasoning and reveal a negative correlation between solving step and problem-specific performance. We confirm the IK issue of LMMs can be effectively improved via knowledge augmentation strategy. More notably, the primary challenge of GPT-4o has significantly transitioned from IK to IG, establishing it as the first LMM advancing towards the knowledge generalization stage. In contrast, other LMMs exhibit a marked inclination towards Rote Memorization they correctly solve composite problems involving multiple knowledge concepts, yet fail in answering sub-problems.

WildChat,"Chatbots such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT are now serving millions of users.

From this, we compiled WildChat, a corpus of 1 million user-ChatGPT conversations, which consists of over 2.5 million interaction turns. We compare WildChat with other popular user-chatbot interaction datasets, and find that our dataset offers the most diverse user prompts, contains the largest number of languages, and presents the richest variety of potentially toxic use-cases for researchers to study. In addition to timestamped chat transcripts, we enrich the dataset with demographic data, including state, country, and hashed IP addresses, alongside request headers. This augmentation allows for more detailed analysis of user behaviors across different geographical regions and temporal dimensions.

WinoGrande,"The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011), a benchmark for commonsense reasoning, is a set of 273 expert-crafted pronoun resolution problems originally designed to be unsolvable for statistical models that rely on selectional preferences or word associations. However, recent advances in neural language models have already reached around 90% accuracy on variants of WSC. This raises an important question whether these models have truly acquired robust commonsense capabilities or whether they rely on spurious biases in the datasets that lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities of machine commonsense. To investigate this question, we introduce WinoGrande, a large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC design, but adjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset. The key steps of the dataset construction consist of (1) a carefully designed crowdsourcing procedure, followed by (2) systematic bias reduction using a novel AfLite algorithm that generalizes human-detectable word associations to machine-detectable embedding associations. The best state-of-the-art methods on WinoGrande achieve 59.4-79.1%, which are 15-35% below human performance of 94.0%, depending on the amount of the training data allowed. Furthermore, we establish new state-of-the-art results on five related benchmarks - WSC (90.1%), DPR (93.1%), COPA (90.6%), KnowRef (85.6%), and Winogender (97.1%). These results have dual implications: on one hand, they demonstrate the effectiveness of WinoGrande when used as a resource for transfer learning. On the other hand, they raise a concern that we are likely to be overestimating the true capabilities of machine commonsense across all these benchmarks. We emphasize the importance of algorithmic bias reduction in existing and future benchmarks to mitigate such overestimation. ", https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10641,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

We run our benchmark on three state-of-the-art chat-LLMs (GPT3.5, GPT4 and Llama2-chat) and show that these models make errors even with as few as three objects. Furthermore, they have quite heavy response biases, preferring certain responses irrespective of the question. Errors persist even with chain-of-thought prompting and in-context learning.

XSTest,"Without proper safeguards, large language models will readily follow malicious instructions and generate toxic content. This risk motivates safety efforts such as red-teaming and large-scale feedback learning, which aim to make models both helpful and harmless. However, there is a tension between these two objectives, since harmlessness requires models to refuse to comply with unsafe prompts, and thus not be helpful. Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that some models may have struck a poor balance, so that even clearly safe prompts are refused if they use similar language to unsafe prompts or mention sensitive topics. In this paper, we introduce a new test suite called XSTest to identify such eXaggerated Safety behaviours in a systematic way. XSTest comprises 250 safe prompts across ten prompt types that well-calibrated models should not refuse to comply with, and 200 unsafe prompts as contrasts that models, for most applications, should refuse.
